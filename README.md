### Using Writerside
You can download JetBrains Writerside from https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/, it's currently free during early access.

You can then create a new project from VCS and enter https://github.com/lewmc/wiki to download the project, edit it and create pull requests.

### Using GitHub, or other text editing software.
Download the project using Git, all pages are in the `/Writerside/topics` directory. Files follow a *mostly* md syntax, with a few extras that are Writerside specific. You can learn more on the Writerside docs if you'd like to use these extra features.
