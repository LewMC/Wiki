# Lew&apos;s Jurassic Pack

Lew's Jurassic Pack was a modpack developed by LewMC containing a number of Jurassic Park/World themed mods.

This mod is still available on [the LewMC website](https://lewmc/net/modpack/lews-jurassic-pack), but is no longer actively developed.

We recommend using Galactica: Jurassic Edition if you'd like to continue playing Jurassic-themed packs from us.
It's actively updated and contains very similar content. You can [access the wiki here](Galactica.md).
