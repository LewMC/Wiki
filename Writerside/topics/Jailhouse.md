# Jailhouse
Jailhouse is a free and easy to use Minecraft banning system. Jailhouse is currently in-development and is not available to download.

## Download Jailhouse

### Release Version
We recommend using '''Modrinth or LewMC''' to download our plugins, ads on the website are unintrusive and help us to keep maintaining the project.

* LewMC: _Not released on this platform._
* Modrinth: _Not released on this platform._
* CurseForge: _Not released on this platform._
* Spigot: _Not released on this platform._
* Hangar: _Not released on this platform._

### Snapshot Version
You can get the snapshot version from our GitHub: [https://github.com/lewmilburn/jailhouse](https://github.com/lewmilburn/jailhouse)

You'll need to compile this version yourself, you'll need to have maven installed.

* Navigate to the essence directory in a terminal program.
* Run <code>mvn package</code>
* The jarfile will be created in the targets directory, you need to use Essence-[version].jar

If you have any issues with this please message Lew on [Discord](https://lewmc.net/discord), you may be able to request a precompiled jar to be sent to you if there's one available for this build. We tend to not publish snapshot versions as they tend to be unstable and are subject to change.
