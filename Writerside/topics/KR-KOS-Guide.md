## Main Menu
The main menu provides quick access to either Manual or Automatic mode.

Manual mode allows you to fine-tune configuration options to your liking.

Automatic mode will ask you a few questions, then configure the server accordingly.

## Automatic

## "Your server does not support this"
If you see this in the menus, it is because your server does not have the required configuration files present to be able to manage them.

If automatic or manual mode is listed as unsupported it is because no configuration files could be found.

To resolve this, please try to restart your server. If this does not help, please check that configuration files are present. You'll need to be using Bukkit or a fork of it (for example: Spigot, Paper, Pufferfish, Purpur, etc.), if you're not you may run into some issues.
