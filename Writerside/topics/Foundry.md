### Snapshot Builds
Snapshot Builds are unstable, pre-release versions of Essence built as soon as changes are pushed to our version control software.

You should not use these versions in production environments, and you should backup your sever before using them.

The branch name appears in a blue bubble, if this says ![main-branch.png](main-branch.png), it's unlikely that this artifact is different from the standard release builds, and you should download it from the official links shown above.
Snapshot Builds will have a branch bubble that looks similar to this: ![1.6.0-branch.png](1.6.0-branch.png)
