# Language Files

Language files are used in Essence to serve messages to players

These are automatically updated whenever you update your plugin.

We currently only support en-gb, you can see a [template here](https://github.com/lewmilburn/Essence/blob/main/src/main/resources/language/en-gb.yml) if you'd like to create a translation. If you have created a translation and would like to add it to Essence please open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/lewmc/essence), thank you.
