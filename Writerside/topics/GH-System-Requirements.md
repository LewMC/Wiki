## Version Support
### Minecraft Version Support
_TLDR; We support the latest version, but may drop support for older versions._

We aim to support as many Minecraft versions as possible, however this may not always be possible.
We generally do not provide updates for older versions of Minecraft if Gatehouse no longer supports it.

We may drop support for certain Minecraft versions due to technical limitations, vulnerabilities, or other reasons.

See the table above for a full list of supported Minecraft versions.

### Gatehouse Version Support
_TLDR; If you're running a version of Gatehouse that is still actively supported, we'll fix any and all bugs and issues._

We'll fix bugs and security issues in any versions of Gatehouse that are in Active Support.
