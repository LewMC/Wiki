### Snapshot Version
You can get the snapshot version from our GitHub: https://github.com/lewmilburn/kryptonite

You'll need to compile this version yourself, you'll need to have maven installed.

* Navigate to the essence directory in a terminal program.
* Run <code>mvn package</code>
* The jarfile will be created in the targets directory, you need to use Kryptonite-[version].jar

If you have any issues with this please message Lew on [https://lewmc.net/discord Discord], you may be able to request a precompiled jar to be sent to you if there's one available for this build. We tend to not publish snapshot versions as they tend to be unstable and are subject to change.
