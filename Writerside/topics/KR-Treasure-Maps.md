# Treasure Maps

Kryptonite may disable or make treasure maps disappear from your world if you have not pre-generated your world.

To enable treasure maps, you should pre-generate your world.
Treasure maps can cause a lag in an world that has not been pre-generated, so Kryptonite disables them if your world is not pre-generated.

If you'd like to override this (not recommended), you can set `override-pregenerated-world-protections` to `true` in `plugins/kryptonite/config.yml`.
