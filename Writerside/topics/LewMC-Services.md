# LewMC Services

LewMC runs a number of web-based services that can allow you to interact with our work.

## Maven Repository
- [Maven Repository](Maven-Repository.md)

## APIs
- [Download Counter API](Download-Counter-API.md)
- [Version API](Version-API.md)

### Privacy

Our APIs do not collect any information about you, our hosting provider may collect some data including IP addresses for security purposes.

We can see how many people have used an endpoint via our hosting provider's dashboard, but we can not see who accessed it.

There are no rate limits, please be respectful and use the API appropriately so we do not have to implement this.
