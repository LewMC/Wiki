# MOTD

The MOTD ("Message of the Day") is a message that appears when a player logs into your server. It can be toggled and managed in the [Configuration](ES-Configuration.md).

MOTDs also support Message Tags. These are used to replace text with pre-generated values set by Essence. You can use these tags to set values that may change often such as versions. [Learn more](ES-Placeholders.md)
