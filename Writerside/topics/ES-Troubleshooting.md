# Troubleshooting

## Invalid move player packet received
This error can sometime occur when a non-vanilla loaded world is set as the main-world if always-spawn is also enabled.
We recommend setting the main-world to a vanilla loaded world (the world set in server.properties) if you also use always-spawn.
