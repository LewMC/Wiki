# Editions

Galactica has two editions: Standard and Jurassic.

The standard edition is simply called "Galactica", and the Jurassic edition "Galactica: Jurassic Edition".

This Wiki covers content for both modpacks, the only difference is that Galactica: Jurassic Edition contains the Jurassic World Reborn mod, whereas Galactica does not.
