If you'd like to use Essence as an economy provider for other plugins you'll need to install Vault.

If you'd like to use prefixes or suffixes in chat, you'll need to install Vault and a permissions plugin such as LuckPerms.

Essence supports PlaceholderAPI, but does not require it. Essence placeholders work in Essence commands with or without it, but if you'd like to use Essence placeholders in other plugins or vice-versa you'll need to install PlaceholderAPI as well.

## Version Support
### Minecraft Version Support
_TLDR; We support the latest version, but may drop support for older versions._

We aim to support as many Minecraft versions as possible, however this may not always be possible.
We generally do not provide updates for older versions of Minecraft if Essence no longer supports it.

We may drop support for certain Minecraft versions due to technical limitations, vulnerabilities, or other reasons.

See the table above for a full list of supported Minecraft versions.

### Essence Version Support
_TLDR; If you're running a version of Essence that is still actively supported, we'll fix any and all bugs and issues._

We'll fix bugs and security issues in any versions of Essence that are in Active Support.
If the version is no longer in Active Support we may not fix the issue.

If you're unusure if we'll fix something, ask! [Open an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/lewmc/essence/issues) and we'll advise there.
You're welcome to fork Essence to fix bugs on older versions yourself if you wish to do so.

## Incompatabilities
### Data packs
- Nice Mobs Remastered: Friends & Foes - causes Essence's /team command to be spammed in the console.
