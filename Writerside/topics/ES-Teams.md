# Teams

## Rules
Rules are a set of values that control gameplay features when players are in teams. You can set these by using `/team rule <rule> <value>` and see what they're currently set as by using `/team rule <rule>`

| Rule                  | Description                   | Accepted Values | Default |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `allow-friendly-fire` | Allows PvP between teammates. | true or false   | true    |

## Team Homes
Alongside having personal homes, teams can also have joint homes. These are set using the `/thome` commands.

You'll need to give players access to the home command wildcard or the thome command permissions. You can find out more on the [commands page](ES-Commands.md).

Team homes work exactly the same as normal homes, except they're shared amongst team members. Every team member can access every team home.
