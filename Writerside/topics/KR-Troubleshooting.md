# Troubleshooting

## Reloading Kryptonite
Reloading your server using the /reload command, or reloading Kryptonite using a plugin such as Plugman can cause a huge number of issues.

As such, we will not provide support for plugin reloaders.

Issues caused can range from permissions lookups failing, memory leaks, zip file exceptions, and more.

We **highly** recommend restarting your server instead of reloading it.
