# Troubleshooting

<warning>
    <strong>Legacy versions of Kryptonite are no longer supported.</strong>
    If you haven't already, we highly recommend updating to Kryptonite 2.0.0 or newer.
</warning>
## Reloading Kryptonite
Reloading your server using the /reload command, or reloading Kryptonite using a plugin such as Plugman can cause a huge number of issues.

As such, we will not provide support for plugin reloaders.

Issues caused can range from permissions lookups failing, memory leaks, zip file exceptions, and more.

We **highly** recommend restarting your server instead of reloading it.

## Kryptonite broke my server, help!
We're sorry to hear our software caused you issues, unfortunately there's not much we can do except advise you to use
one of your backups.

Please send us a copy of your logs and config files via [GitHub](https://github.com/lewmc/kryptonite)
and we'll look into what caused the issue.
