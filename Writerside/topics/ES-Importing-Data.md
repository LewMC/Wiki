# Importing Data

As of Essence 1.7.0, you can import data from other plugins.

<warning>
    <strong>You should back up your server <u>before</u> importing data.</strong>
    If you have any issues please contact our support team.
</warning>

This will import your spawns, warps, and homes from the plugins that support them.
