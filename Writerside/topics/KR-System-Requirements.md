## Version Support
### Minecraft Version Support
_TLDR; We support the latest version, but may drop support for older versions._

We aim to support as many Minecraft versions as possible, however this may not always be possible.
We generally do not provide updates for older versions of Minecraft if Kryptonite no longer supports it.

We may drop support for certain Minecraft versions due to technical limitations, vulnerabilities, or other reasons.

See the table above for a full list of supported Minecraft versions.

### Kryptonite Version Support
_TLDR; If you're running a version of Kryptonite that is still actively supported, we'll fix any and all bugs and issues._

We'll fix bugs and security issues in any versions of Kryptonite that are in Active Support.
If the version is no longer in Active Support we may not fix the issue.

If you're unusure if we'll fix something, ask! [Open an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/lewmc/kryptonite/issues) and we'll advise there.
You're welcome to fork Kryptonite to fix bugs on older versions yourself if you wish to do so.
