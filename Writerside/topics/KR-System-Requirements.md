## Minecraft Version Support
We aim to support as many Minecraft versions as possible, however this may not always be possible.

We generally do not provide bug fixes for older versions of Minecraft if newer versions of Kryptonite no longer support it.
If you're unusure if we'll fix something, ask! [Open an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/lewmc/kryptonite/issues) and we'll advise there.
If you're running a version of Kryptonite that is still actively supported, we'll fix any and all bugs and issues.

We may drop support for certain Minecraft versions due to technical limitations, vulnerabilities, or other reasons.

## Folia Support
Kryptonite supports Folia-based Minecraft Server Software in versions 1.3.0 and greater.
