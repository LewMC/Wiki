# Backup your Server

You should always backup your server before using any Kryptonite functions.

Kryptonite is reliable, heavily tested software, but let's be safe. It is your responsibility to ensure backups are taken,
and we can't take any responsibility for broken servers, even though it is incredibly unlikely to happen.

## Why?
Whilst we take every precaution to ensure that your server is safe using our software,
and we haven't had any reports of Kryptonite breaking any servers, we'd like you to be safe.
We cannot guarantee that everything will always work perfectly.

We have programmed a number of safetynets for values you can edit directly.
However, should one of our safetynets fail, or a malicious user figures out a way to bypass them, it's incredibly useful to have a backup.
You must remember that Kryptonite is interfacing directly with your server's configuration - **never give untrusted users OP**.

It's also just good practice to backup your server anyway as well, just in case!

## How?
Your server hosting provider may have a backup option on your hosting panel - you can ask them for more information.

If not, you can compress (zip) your server folder and save a copy somewhere else. That works too!

## Kryptonite broke my server, help!
Congratulations, you're the first!

We're sorry to hear our software caused you issues, unfortunately there's not much we can do except advise you to use
one of your backups.

Please send us a copy of your logs and config files via [GitHub](https://gihub.com/lewmc/kryptonite)
and we'll look into what caused the issue.
